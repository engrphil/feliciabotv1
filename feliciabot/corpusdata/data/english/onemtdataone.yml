conversations:
- -  Are the same modules used to teach elementary and high school teachers? How will that work, since both groups teach different courses and students from a different age group?
  - I can
- - How flexible are these courses? Since, the teachers are at work during the week, will the teachers be able to complete the courses within the span of one year if they dedicate only their weekends to this?
  - The courses are self-paced, and are designed such that learners study at their convenience. They can even be accessed on an app on their mobile devices. While it may take an average of 12 months to achieve Black Belt, some learners may take a shorter time or even longer. It depends on the learner.
- - What happens when the learner doesn’t pass a particular module? Will he/she have to give the exam again?
  - Yes, the teacher is required to take the quizzes as many times as it takes to pass before moving on.
- - Is there any way (tool/technique) to ensure that the knowledge and skills acquired are actually put to use in the classroom?
  - The essence of the program is to effect positive student outcomes. If your students are not getting better, then something is wrong. Hence the evaluation for the black belts allow schools and parents to evaluate the performance of the teachers, which then determines whether they get the rewards or not.
- - There exist a lot of schools that do not have the required government approval yet, are they allowed to enroll for the training as well?
  - Our main concern is to improve the capacity of teachers. We are not in a position to determine who gets trained and who doesnt. We will train any school or anyone who is interested- even those who are currently not teaching in classrooms. Parents can register for the purpose of helping their children at home. It is open to all, including the school owners. Moreover, this program is an independent teacher development program that in no way replaces the already existing requirements set by the authorities. It complements the requirements instead. It is our way of ensuring that only teachers who have the KSAs get rewarded- a key platform of our objective.
- - What is the belief base of the visionaries of this program?
  - We would like to point out that at 1MillionTeachers, we do not do anything based on religion. We are set on a mission to do a collective good to Africa through this organization. We particularly encourage religion tolerance.
- - Will public schools be included in the program?
  - Yes, public schools are included. The teachers can either sponsor themselves or government can (Here is where the state and federal government come in).
- - What are the metrics being used to categorize the private school?
  - Things like the location, school structure, ambience, school fees, calibre of teachers determine whether schools are high income or low income private schools.
- - What does the curriculum cover?
  - The curriculum covers all the essentials of teaching- the things that a teacher ought to know to be effective- from classroom management, to handling difficult children, to relating with parents, school leadership, learning and motivation, special needs education, STEM subjects, civics, literacy and numeracy etc. For the teachers who already have some knowledge and expertise in those areas, it is a bonus. This means that their learning curve will be less steep. The program ensures that whoever goes through our system not only has the knowledge, skills and the ability to be a teacher, but also ensure that they are engaged, motivated, dedicated and are focused on improving the learning outcomes for their students. Our primary objective is to have teachers who make a difference in the lives of their students, that is what we want to celebrate and reward. We are not here to replace any certification provided by the governments or authorities. What we offer is a different pathway to excellence, and that the existing models are not functional and needs to be changed. If the teachers are not engaged and motivated it does not really matter what or how much they know.
- - Is 1MillionTeachers supported by the Canadian government?  
  - We aim is to eventually get an official endorsement of the federal government through the Global Affairs Canada and the high commissioner in Nigeria. But currently, we are only supported by Innovate Kingston. Ontario 150 provided most of the funding for the breakout project which itself is a brainchild of Innovate Kingston and the city of Kingston. The Breakout Project in turn gave 1MillionTeachers a platform to tell the world about our project. It is however safe to say that we are strongly supported by the Smith School of Business, the Centre for Social Impact at Queens University as well as the faculty Education at Queens University. The first batch of professors and graduate students in Nigeria for the boot camp.
- - What is the next step once school have agreed to register their teachers as learners?
  - Once the teachers agree to enroll their teachers, they will pay the fees into our account. Once the payment is confirmed, we request them for the details of participating teacher, and then generate personal codes for them to use for registration. Once registered, they can commence their training. All the selected schools for the pilot will commence training on the same day, the 25th of July.
- - How does a learner start his/her training?
  - Once a learner pays we confirm the payment and send you a code. The learner logs on to the 1 Million Teachers website, www.1millionteachers.com, selects the "Begin Your Training " tab which takes you to the learning portal. The learner creates your account. A link is sent to the learner’s email for verification. Finally, the learner use the link to register. Once the account setup is complete and the learner’s can begin your training.
- - I have a school that are willing to register 5 teachers but just for a month before 25th. Which I advice I should be for like 6month. They said the just finished the graduation stuff. They don't have the cash now. Please what do u advice?
  - You can sign them on. If they meet the deadline before July 25. They will still get the 20% discount for pilot schools, but only for the 1 month. Please reach out to Yinka to advise on how they will pay.
- - Is there a qualification you need to participate in the program?
  - There is no special qualification to participate, as long as you can read and write. Anyone can participate, even none teachers. We have been approached by parents who just want to be able to help their kids with homework, and school owners who just need tools to make them better administrators and how to profitably run their schools. So, the program is for everyone involved in education even though the emphasis is on teachers. Remember, we are not trying to replace or redefine the standards set by the authorities responsible for regulating the standards of education. Our program aims to fill the gaps in teacher deficiency and qualification while adding addition the motivation piece to keep teachers engage and make them lifelong learners. Unlike the Existing traditional classroom training which is time consuming, unaffordable, that is unsuitable for training large numbers of people at once, that removes teachers from classroom wasting valuable teaching teaching times leading to pressures to reduce training time – that results in sub-optimal changes in performance,  our program is online + classroom based training, delivered in bite-size, self paced, convenient, and easy to track progress through the personal dashboard . It is also reward based - the incentives keep teachers engaged and motivated overall increasing students’ outcomes.
- -  approximately how long does it take to get to the black belt, and does it mean some of us in Zimbabwe will be able to come to Canada?
  - The training is self-paced, so it depends on the individual. Some very diligent individuals are able to get to black belt within 6 to 9 months.
- - Is this training internationally recognized, or does it give you an Advantage if you want to seek for teaching positions abroad?
  - Our contents are designed to meet the needs of the common wealth countries, created by experts from the various common wealth countries. They meet the highest levels of international standards. Our instructional designer is a renowned expert in the field with over 15 years working in the field with organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nation. Also, with the involvement of the Faculty of Education at Queens University, Canada, we are working towards getting course credits that can be a big boost when you seek to further your studies. This will take some time though. Our value proposition is Best for the world teacher training, at the cost of 12 cups of premium coffee.
- - How long does it take training for a certificate or Diploma?
  - The training is self-paced, so it depends on the individual. Some very diligent individuals are able to get to black belt within 6 to 9 months.
- - Can we say 1MT is a project supported by the Canadian government? I know the Ontario 150 connection but would it be a true statement to tell people that it's supported by the Canadian government? 
  - We may get an official endorsement of the federal government, but we are not in a possible to say that at the moment. Innovate Kingston, and the City of Kingston are strong supporters. Ontario 150 provided most of the funding for The Breakout Project which itself is a brainchild of Innovate Kingston and the City of Kingston. The Breakout Project in turn gave 1 MT a platform to tell the world about our project. It is however safe to say that we are strongly supported by the Smith School of Business, the Centre for Social Impact at Queens University as well as the Faculty of Education at Queens University. In fact, the faculty will lead the design and delivery of the workshops working with local resource persons in Nigeria. The first batch of professors and graduate students will be in Nigeria for the boot camp. Canada is 150 years old as a federating unit this year, that is why there are various initiatives at the federal level and across the provinces and cities. The Breakout Project is one of those initiatives. It seeks to celebrate the essence of Canada- innovation, multiculturalism, diversity, inclusion, global citizenship, etc. 1 Million Teachers embodies all those values that is why we were selected for TBP.
- - Does the regular monthly pricing, discounted pricing for 12 months, bundle rate etc apply to all? Is it general?
  - Yes, but only the final 20% discount is applicable to those participating in the pilot program.
- - Once schools accept to register teachers, what's the next step? What documentation is required? How is payment processed?
  - Once they agree to enroll their teachers, they will pay the fees into our account. Once payment is confirmed, we will request for the details of participating teachers, and then generate personal codes for them to use for registration. Once registered, they can commence their training.
- -  What's the required qualifications for getting enrolled in the program and is it possible to pick some modules and leave others based on one's qualifications or interest?
  - At the moment, the pilot program is only open to schools. Individual teachers will be able to register- even non- teachers who are interested in gaining knowledge about teaching after the pilot program. There is no requirement to participate only a desire to be a better teacher.
- - What do you mean by reward based teacher development and low cost evaluation and measurement?
  - There are several other modules like classroom management, dealing with difficult children, special and inclusive education, learning and motivation, communicating with stakeholders such as parents, etc. The selected modules are based on the key requirements for effective teaching. They will continue to be tweaked to meet the current needs of students and teachers.
- - How much will it cost to do the program?
  - Its a subscription based fee structure that gives access to the portal as long as the subscription is active. There are various fees, depending on individual situation.
- - What relationship do one million Teachers have with Queens university Canada. Does the program give one any consideration for admission into the university?
  - For those who are already advanced in knowledge and experience, good for them. It means their learning curve will be less steep. The Faculty of Education at Queens University, Canada is a key supporter. The boot camps and other sessions to be organized by them will reinforce most of what is learned online as well as introduce new knowledge.
- - Where can I access application/ registration forms?

- - Where can I download the app for my mobile device?
  - Android phone users can download “iSpring Learn” on GooglePlay and Iphone users can download “iSpring Learn” on Apple store.
- - How do i go back on failed courses? 
  - You can always go back to any section of each of the modules you didn’t complete and take it again. Because you need those points. Try logout and login again if you find it difficult to navigate back. If you have already done the NPS quiz and passed the final assessment, do not worry. There are many issues such as this that we are working to fix. They do not affect your performance because your response has already been recorded when you did it the first time. I would be worried only if you did not pass the final assessment but otherwise you are fine.
